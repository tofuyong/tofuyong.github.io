<b>Thoughts about a career transition from Education to Healthcare to Tech<b>

I started my career as a teacher. Young, bright-eyed and idealistic, I thought I had landed my dream job because I had always known that I wanted to be a teacher since I was a kid. The idea of teaching and helping others to become a better version of themselves was my calling. Of course the reality of teaching is not as rosy as I soon discovered. Teaching teenagers in today's world requires superhuman powers which me-in-my-twenties lacked. But perhaps, more on that for another time. 

Compelled by my love to teach and to connect with my students at a deeper level, I moved on to free-lance tutoring. I really enjoyed the challenge it presented, as there was that element of managing a business that was completely new to me. When parents are paying a premium compared to government schools, they also expect a lot more. During this period, I brushed up on my teaching (and may I say, counselling as well, as my students opened up about their problems in a one-on-one setting) skills. I also had to learn how to market my services and put myself out there for greater visibility and outreach. 

This experience forced me out of my shell and I became more daring to speak up and fend for myself. I became less fearful of rejection (yes there were parents who let me go right after their child failed a school test) and also learnt the importance of communicating my thoughts clearly to achieve my goals.

Those two years of tutoring also presented a wonderful opportunity for me to train for a 100km ultramarathon. With my tutoring job beginning in the evenings when the kids get off school, I had time in the mornings to go for long runs. As much as I was no longer a teacher officially, I think the part of me that continues to enjoy connecting with, nurturing and helping others will always remain with me. 

Soon, an opportunity to work in a hospital with a team that treats Eating Disorders patients presented itself, and I jumped on it. I learnt alot during my brief stint there, working with psychiatrists, psychologists, dietitians and other healthcare staff. More importantly, it was an introspective period and I came to realise that my career choices thus far had led me to develop a genuine compassion to care for and help others. I had become adept at listening to and I mean really listen, and interacting with students, patients, parents and colleagues. 

But in the safe cocoon of the school and hospital environments, I felt like I was living in a bubble and no longer growing. I wanted so much more. I was 32, not so young anymore, but still idealistic about the world and driven to impact and make a difference on a much larger scale. Surely, there is something out there that is a better fit for my need for challenge and enjoyment? 

As much as everyone wants out of the cut-throat corporate rat race, this mystical 'corporate world' that everyone speaks of with disgust yet wears like a badge of honour, had always been so alluring but so out of reach. I tidied up my résumé and brushed up on my interview skills. I was ready to upskill and was set on entering the corporate world. Fortunately for me, there are a couple of career conversion programmes out there for career switchers like myself to pivot into a new industry. I wanted to be right at the cutting-edge of change, and made up my mind on Tech, knowing full well that with no prior experience, I had a lot of catching up to do. 

I suspect my lack of technical knowledge was overlooked by my earnestness to learn. After rounds of interviews, I eventually had 5 offers and went with the Financial Institution that I felt would take the best care of a rookie like me. (Yes you will discover along the way that I make alot of decisions based on feelings, very much unlike your traditional engineer.) 

So 2023 was a brand new start for me. 

From January-April, I went to the National University of Singapore to embark on my training as a full-stack developer. To condense the four months into one sentence would be to say that "It was filled with a lot of self-doubt, frustrations but at the end of it, joy." A great deal of positive self-talk was needed to get myself to stay the course. I got to learn so much about myself, especially in the way I think. I always thought that I was a meticulous person but programming made me realise that I have the tendency to make assumptions and make logical leaps. I'm also very much a big-picture sort of person, the absence of which is like asking me to piece together a jigsaw with no image of the end outcome in mind.   

But you know what? I enjoyed this period of school tremendously. I am grateful to the three instructors at NUS whose guidance shaped me into a more confident programmer. Beyond learning, I cherished the moments of interactions with my instructors who shared insights into the industry, preparing me for the challenges that lie ahead. 

I also seized the opportunity to network with my classmates, each with their own unique reasons for doing a career switch. I always believe that there is something to learn from everyone, no matter which stage of life everyone's at. It was refreshing to bounce ideas with my classmates and listen to how they structure and communicate their thoughts, approaching the same problem with a different solution.

Fast forward to July 2023. I have completed 6 months of full stack bootcamp at NUS and completed my capstone project (I created a Student Management App for free-lance tutors) and am now ready to embark on the next phase of the career transition, the real part I would say! It's exhilarating to know that all the intricacies of the corporate world will finally be demystified as I step into it myself!

I am excited to see what lies ahead in this new chapter! I am so grateful for this chance and I hope to learn a lot and create meaningful connections with the teams and individuals I have the privilege to work with.
