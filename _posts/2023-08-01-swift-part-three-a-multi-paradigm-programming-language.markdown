<p><i>
I've come to learn that Swift supports multiple programming paradigms namely object-oriented programming (OOP), functional programming (FP), and protocol-oriented programming (POP). This makes it a highly versatile language that allows programmers to write in a variety of styles, depending on the problem at hand, or I guess a matter of personal preference and flair.

<p><b>Protocol-Oriented Programming</b></p>

{% highlight swift %}

{% endhighlight swift %}


<p><b>Protocol extensions</b></p> are used to add functionality to protocols. This means we donâ€™t need to copy that functionality across many structs and classes.

<p><b>Functional Programming</b></p>

<p><b>Object-Oriented Programming</b></p>

To summarise, we use:
- POP for sharing behaviour across different types
- FP for data transformation
- OOP for complex hierarchies
